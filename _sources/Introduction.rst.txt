AdvSecureNet - Adversarial Secure Networks - is a Python library for Machine Learning Security. It has been developed by `Melih Catal <https://github.com/melihcatal>`_ at the `University of Zurich <https://www.uzh.ch/en.html>`_ as a part of his Master's Thesis under the supervision of `Prof. Dr. Manuel GÃ¼nther <https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/aiml/people/guenther.html>`_.

The library provides a set of tools to generate adversarial examples and to evaluate the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. It also provides a set of tools to train robust machine learning models. The library is built on top of `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_. It is designed to be modular and extensible. So, anyone can easily run experiments with different configurations.
