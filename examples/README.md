This folder contains examples of how to use the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit. The examples are organized in subfolders according to the type of task they address. We provide examples for both API and CLI usage. The examples are written in Python and can be run in a Jupyter notebook environment. The following is a list of the examples available:

### API Examples

- [**Adversarial Attacks**](./advsecurenet/adversarial_attacks/adversarial_attacks.ipynb): This file contains examples of how to use the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit to generate adversarial examples.
- [**Benign Training**](./advsecurenet/benign_training/benign_training.ipynb): This file shows how to train a benign model using the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit. It also demonstrates how to use a external model to train.
- [**Adversarial Training**](./advsecurenet/defenses/adversarial_training/adversarial_training.ipynb): This file shows how to train an adversarial model using the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit.
- [**Evaluation**](./advsecurenet/evaluation/evaluation.ipynb): This file shows how to use the evaluators provided by the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit to evaluate the performance of a model, attack, or defense.

### CLI Examples

- [**Distributed Adversarial Attacks**](./cli/adversarial_attacks/distributed): This folder contains examples of how to use the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit to generate adversarial examples in a distributed manner.
- [**Non-Distributed Adversarial Attacks**](./cli/adversarial_attacks/distributed): This folder contains examples of how to use the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit to generate adversarial examples in a non-distributed manner.
- [**Distributed Benign Training**](./cli/benign_training/distributed): This folder contains examples of how to train a benign model using the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit in a distributed manner.
- [**Non-Distributed Benign Training**](./cli/benign_training/non_distributed): This folder contains examples of how to train a benign model using the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit in a non-distributed manner.
- [**Distributed Adversarial Training**](./cli/defenses/adversarial_training/distributed): This folder contains examples of how to train an adversarial model using the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit in a distributed manner.
- [**Non-Distributed Adversarial Training**](./cli/defenses/adversarial_training/non_distributed): This folder contains examples of how to train an adversarial model using the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit in a non-distributed manner.
- [**Adversarial Evaluation**](./cli/evaluation/adversarial_evaluation): This folder contains examples of how to use the evaluators provided by the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit to evaluate the performance of a model, attack, or defense. There are examples for both distributed and non-distributed evaluation.
- [**Benign Evaluation**](./cli/evaluation/benign_evaluation): This folder contains examples of how to use the evaluators provided by the `AdvSecureNet` toolkit to evaluate the performance of a model in a benign setting.
