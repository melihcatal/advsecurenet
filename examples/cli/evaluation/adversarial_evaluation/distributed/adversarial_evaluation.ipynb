    "# Distributed Adversarial Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Adversarial Evaluation is a key component of the robustness evaluation of machine learning models. There are different ways to evaluate the robustness of a model, efficiency of a defense mechanism or the adversarial attack itself. `advsecurenet` supports a variety of adversarial evaluation techniques. Such evaluations might be time consuming by their nature. Therefore, `advsecurenet` provides a distributed adversarial evaluation option to speed up the evaluation process. In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use distributed adversarial evaluation in `advsecurenet` CLI.\n"

You can also specify the output directory by passing the `-o` flag followed by the path to the directory where you want to save the configuration file. If you don't provide the `-o` flag, the configuration file will be saved in the current working directory with the name `adversarial_evaluation_config.yml`. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. If the output path is a directory, the configuration file will be saved in that directory with the name `adversarial_evaluation_config.yml`.\n",
